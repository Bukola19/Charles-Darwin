# Project: DNA Sequencing Analysis
This project contains a Bash script designed to automate the analysis of DNA sequencing data. The script downloads sequencing data, performs quality control, trims sequences, maps the genome, and calls variants.

**Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following programs installed on your system before running the script:
wget for downloading data files.
fastp for quality control and sequence trimming.
bwa for genome mapping.
samtools for handling SAM and BAM files.
bcftools for variant calling.

**Usage**
Clone this repository to your system:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd your_project
Run the bash script:
bash script.sh

The script will perform the following actions:

Data Download: Download DNA sequencing data files from a remote repository.

Quality Control and Trimming: Use fastp to perform quality control and trimming of DNA sequences.

Genome Mapping: Use bwa to map the trimmed DNA sequences to the reference genome.

Variant Calling: Use bcftools to call variants from the mapped files.

**Project Structure**
script.sh: The main script that automates the DNA sequencing analysis.
data/: Directory to store downloaded data files.
fastqc_out/: Directory to store quality control results.
bwa_output/: Directory to store output files from genome mapping.
bcf_output/: Directory to store output files from variant calling.
